# 🏠 Linear Regression - Housing Price Prediction

This project is part of the **AI & ML Internship - Task 3: Linear Regression**.  
The objective is to implement and understand both **Simple** and **Multiple Linear Regression** using the **Housing Price Prediction** dataset.

---

## 📌 Task Objectives

- Import and preprocess the dataset  
- Perform train-test split  
- Fit a Linear Regression model using `sklearn.linear_model`  
- Evaluate using MAE, MSE, R² Score  
- Visualize the regression performance  
- Interpret model coefficients  

---

## 📊 Dataset

- **Source**: [Kaggle - Housing Price Prediction](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/harishkumardatalab/housing-price-prediction)  
- **File Used**: `Housing.csv`  
- Make sure to **upload the dataset manually** to your Google Colab environment or configure the Kaggle API if automating downloads.

## 🛠️ Libraries Used

- `pandas`  
- `numpy`  
- `matplotlib`  
- `seaborn`  
- `sklearn` (for modeling and evaluation)
